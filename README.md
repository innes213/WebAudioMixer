WebAudioMixer
=============

WebAudio Mixer Test

This is an exploration of the Web Audio API via the implementation of an audio mixing console. 
This app must be deployed on a server in order to work properly.

Currently, all audio tracks are the same. This is done to easily identify timing issues between
channels. Track is from ccmixer (http://ccmixter.org/files/unreal_dm/45426). New tracks and 
option for user-specified tracks to come later.

## Note
This is one of the earliest web projects I did. I'm not actively maintaining it and it's around for kicks.
